## Intro to MaxBack!
**MaxBack** our fullstack project for the hackathon at the Capital One Software Engineering Summit, where we **recieved praise** for it's use and benefit to both banks and it's customers!

Many cards have rotational benefits and it is hard to keep track of which benefits occur when. Hence, to fully utilize benefits, our app **determines your location and automatically suggests one of your cards to use** if you're, for example, at the gas station or at Walmart. 

Check out the gif below for a walkthrough!

## Slide Deck 
Check out our pitch deck below! We started off with a scenario in which the user was on a long line at a Walmart. When finally reaching the register, we had the user frantically decide the best card to use to maximize their benefits. 

This all-too-common scenario has happened to many of us, and helped the judges understand the possible impact of our project!
