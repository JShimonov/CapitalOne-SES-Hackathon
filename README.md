## Intro to MaxBack!
MaxBack our fullstack project for the hackathon at the Capital One Software Engineering Summit.

Our idea was to create an app that would help credit card holders maximize their benefits. Many cards have rotational benefits and it is hard to keep track of which benefits occur when. 

Hence, to fully utilize benefits, our app determines your location and automatically suggests one of your cards to use if you're, for example, at the gas station or at Walmart.
